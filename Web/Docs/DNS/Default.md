# DNS

At its simplest, DNS is often described as the phonebook of the internet. It converts names we remember, like `google.com`, to IP addresses we'd prefer to not even see, like `74.125.237.114` or `2404:6800:4006:800::1014`.

You'll also find DNS to play a critical part in delivering email, connecting VOIP calls, routing IMs and load balancing web traffic.
