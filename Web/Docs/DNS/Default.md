# DNS

At its simplest, DNS is often described as the phonebook of the internet. It converts names we know, like `google.com`, to IP addresses, like `74.125.237.114` or `2404:6800:4006:800::1014`.

You'll also find DNS to be a critical part of delivering your email, connecting your VOIP call, routing your IM or load balancing your web traffic.
